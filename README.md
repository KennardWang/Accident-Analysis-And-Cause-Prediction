### Data Specification

|Column|Range|Representitive|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|District|1~12|12 different districts in our city|
|Time|0~23|24 hours|
|Cause|1~4|4 different main causes: 1 = collision with car; 2 = collision with bicycle or pedestrian; 3 = collision with construction materials such as building, road infrastructure, trees and animals; 4 = extreme weather & unpredicted accidents

------
### Task
1. Do a research on a relationship among district, time and main cause during a car accident.
2. Analyse rudimentary data and plot.
3. Try to build a model to predict main cause if district and time information are given.
